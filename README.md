SPARC Assembly Syntax Highlighting for Sublime Text
=============

Syntax defintion for SPARC assembly for use with Sublime Text. Using SPARC in my assembly class and I couldn't find a good package out there. So I made one. To install put the SPARC folder inside the Sublime Text packages folder.

Update: Since making this [Austin Anderson](https://github.com/ProtractorNinja) has contacted me to let me know of his package for Sublime Text which you can get [here](https://github.com/ProtractorNinja/SPARC-sublime) (soon to be added to Package Control), his is much more extensive than mine and while you can use mine if you'd like I encourage you to check out his package.
